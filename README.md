# WUT documentation with actually useful search

The search functionality in the [orginal Doxygen documentation](https://wut.devkitpro.org/) is unusable, so I created a mirror using [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) for searching.

This documentation update is triggered manually, but since WUT isn't particularly fast-changing software, it should be fine. If you notice that this version is outdated, please notify me by creating an issue.
