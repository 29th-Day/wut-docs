# WUT documentation with actually useful search

The search in the [orginal doxygen documentation](https://wut.devkitpro.org/) is unusable so I created a mirror using [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) for searching.

This documentation update is triggered manually but since WUT isn't a particular fast changing software it should be fine. If you notice that this version is old, please notify me by creating an issue.
